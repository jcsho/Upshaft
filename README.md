# Upshaft

***An Indie 2D Action Platformer***

---

Upshaft is an arcade-style vertical platformer intended to be easy to pick up but hard to master. Players play as a miner running from a giant mole while traversing a treacherous mineshaft full of crumbling platforms, falling rocks, and other dangerous hazards. Using power ups found along the way like wings, rocket boots, coin magnets, and weapons, players must reach the surface to escape the moleâ€™s wrath. Designed to be a short time waster, people can pick up and play Upshaft anytime, anywhere.
